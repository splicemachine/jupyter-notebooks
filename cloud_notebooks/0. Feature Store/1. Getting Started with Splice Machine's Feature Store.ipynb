    "\n",
    "* #### Splice Machine's platform is powered by a single, hybrid, SQL database \n",
    "    * Most databases are optimized to do either analytic or transacational operations. Data warehouses (Snowflake, Redshift, Teradata) are optimized to do big batch analytic operations while traditional datbases (Oracle, Postgres, MySQL) are optimized to do quick primary key lookups and short range scans. Splice Machine's underlying databse is a hybrid, it does both!\n",
