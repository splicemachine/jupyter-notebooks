    "## Local Development of the Custom Code in an IDE\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps described here will be for a Mac, but the process is generally the same for Linux. Using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is usually the best approach when developing code, since development is straightforward, as is the generation of the desired output; in this case, a JDK 1.8-compatible JAR file. We'll be using IntelliJ IDEA here, though most IDEs should work as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow these steps to develop your code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set up Your Project\n",
    "2. Configure Your Project to Output a JAR File\n",
    "3. Write Your Code\n",
    "4. Build Your JAR File\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Set Up Your Project\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow these steps to set up your project in IntelliJ IDEA:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select *File -> New -> Project...*.\n",
    "2. Choose *Java with 1.8 as the Project SDK*, then click *Next*.\n",
    "3. You can optionally decide to create from a template. Click *Next*.\n",
    "4. Give your project a name and location; e.g. `CompanyACustom1`.\n",
    "5. If desired, select *File -> New -> Package* to create a new package; e.g. `com.splicemachine.companya`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Configure Your Project to Output a JAR file\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow these steps in IntelliJ IDEA to have your project output a JAR file:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select *File -> Project Structure...*.\n",
    "2. Select *Artifacts*, then click *+*.\n",
    "3. Choose *JAR -> From modules with dependencies*.\n",
    "3. Select *Build on make*, then click *OK*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Write Your Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can write your code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a file by right-clicking on your *src* or *package* folder, then select *New -> Java Class*.\n",
    "2. Add your code. Here's a simple example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "package com.splicemachine.companya;\n",

    "\n",
    "            String incrementSQL = \"update SPLICE.INCREMENTTEST set i = i + 1\";\n",
    "\n",
    "            try (PreparedStatement ps = con.prepareStatement(incrementSQL)) {\n",
    "                int resultSet = ps.executeUpdate();\n",
    "            } catch (SQLException e) {\n",

    "### 4. Build Your JAR File\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, build your JAR file and start testing by following these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select *Build -> Artifacts... JAR*.\n",
    "2. Use your command line interface to navigate to your JAR file; e.g. `out/artifacts/CompanyACustom1_jar/Custom1.jar`.\n",
    "3. Deploy your JAR file for testing.\n"

    "* The example above is a stored procedure, which means that it does not return results. If you're writing a function, it needs to return a result.\n",
