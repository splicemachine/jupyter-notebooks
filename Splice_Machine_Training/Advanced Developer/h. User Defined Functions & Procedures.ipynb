    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, Splice Machine strongly recommends that you develop your custom Java code using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) on your local machine. That way you can develop, test, and tune locally, before deploying to a full cluster. The product of your code should be a JDK 1.8-compatible JAR file.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll show you one example of a custom function and a custom procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following steps are for developing your custom code using the IntelliJ IDEA on MacOS:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. _Set up your project_\n",
    "2. _Configure it to output a JAR file_\n",
    "3. _Code your function or procedure_\n",
    "4. _Build your JAR file_\n",
    "5. _Deploy and test your code_\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Set Up Your Project\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow these steps to set up your project in IntelliJ IDEA:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select `File -> New -> Project...`\n",
    "2. Choose `Java with 1.8` as the Project SDK\n",
    "3. Skip creating from a template unless you prefer to use one\n",
    "4. Give your project a name and location; for example: `CompanyACustom1`\n",
    "5. If desired, create a new package (`File -> New -> Package`), such as `com.splicemachine.companya`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Configuring It to Output a JAR File\n",
    "\n",
    "Now follow these steps in IntelliJ IDEA to build a JAR file:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select `File -> Project Structure...`\n",
    "2. Select `Artifacts`, and click `+`\n",
    "3. Choose `JAR -> From modules with dependencies `\n",
    "3. Check `Build on make` and then click `OK`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Code Your Function or Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow these steps to create your code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a file by right-clicking on your src or package folder, and selecting `New -> Java Class`\n",
    "2. Paste in code like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "package com.splicemachine.companya;\n",

    "### 4. Build Your JAR File\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, follow these steps to build your JAR file:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Build -> Artifacts... JAR`\n",
    "2. Use your command line interface to navigate to where the JAR file is created, e.g. out/artifacts/CompanyACustom1_jar/Custom1.jar\n",

    "## Development Guidelines\n",
    "Before we develop the code and deploy the JAR file, it is worth going through some simple best practices:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It's useful for code organization to use a package for the code, e.g. `com.splicemachine.yourcompanyname`.\n",
    "2. Notice you don't need a `main` code block in your class, because you'll be directly calling the class's specific method.\n",
    "3. The example we've shown is a stored procedure, which means it does not return any results. If you create a function, it _must_ return a result.\n",
    "4. You need to ensure that your method throws `SQLException` if SQL is being executed.  Be sure to use `try/catch` blocks similar to those shown in the example, to deal with any possible run-time exceptions.\n"
