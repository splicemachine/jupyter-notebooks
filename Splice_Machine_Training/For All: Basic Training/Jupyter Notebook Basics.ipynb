    "* Notebooks are broken into *paragraphs*. You are now viewing the first paragraph in this notebook.\n",

    "* Each paragraph has a *cell type* (sometimes called a backend) that knows how to process the source content in the paragraph. \n",
    "  We are using the *markdown* interpreter in the paragraph that you're currently reading. Markdown generates HTML from easy-to-read, plain text input that uses simplified formatting instructions.\n",
    " \n",
    "* You run a paragraph by clicking the *Run* button at the top. After the paragraph runs, you can see its results. For example, the result of running this Markdown paragraph is to see the formatted text that you are currently reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next paragraph in this notebook, which is immediately below this paragraph, is an empty Markdown paragraph. You can enter markdown text into it to see how a Markdown paragraph works. Follow these steps:\n",
