    "The *environment* in which your stored procedure code is developed may change depending upon your need: we recommend that you flesh out the actual functionality of your custom code in a local (standalone) Splice Machine envirmonment. Once you have refined your code and it behaves to your satisfaction in your local environment, you can then re-deploy the developed code to your target instance. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook covers all of these steps - though as you will see, these steps occur OUTSIDE of an actual Notebook when running in a local environment. Replace any instances of `<your-file-name>` in the examples with your specific file name, rememberig to remove the `<` and `>` brackets.\n"

    "## Local Development of the Custom Code in an IDE\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, Splice Machine strongly recommends that you develop your custom Java code using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) on your local machine. This is most frequently done on a Mac or Linux computer. That way you can develop, test, and tune locally, before deploying to a full cluster. The product of your code should be a JDK 1.8-compatible JAR file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following steps are for developing your procedure using the IntelliJ IDEA on MacOS:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting Up Your Project\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside of IntelliJ IDEA, do the following:\n",
    "1. Select `File -> New -> Project...`\n",
    "2. Choose `Java with 1.8` as the Project SDK\n",
    "3. Skip creating from a template unless you prefer to use one\n",
    "4. Give your project a name and location; for example: `CompanyACustom1`\n",
    "5. If desired, create a new package (`File -> New -> Package`), such as `com.splicemachine.companya`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuring to output a JAR file\n",
    "Inside of IntelliJ IDEA, do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select `File -> Project Structure...`\n",
    "2. Select `Artifacts`, and click `+`\n",
    "3. Choose `JAR -> From modules with dependencies `\n",
    "3. Check `Build on make` and then click `OK`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coding your function or procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a file by right-clicking on your src or package folder, and selecting `New -> Java Class`\n",
    "2. Paste in code like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "package com.splicemachine.companya;\n",
    "\n",
    "import java.sql.SQLException;\n",
    "import java.sql.Connection;\n",
    "import java.sql.DriverManager;\n",
    "import java.sql.PreparedStatement;\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "public class Custom1 {\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    public static void customIncrement () throws SQLException {\n",
    "        try (Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(\"jdbc:default:connection\")) {\n",
    "\n",
    "            String incrementSQL = \"update SPLICE.INCREMENTTEST set i = i + 1\";\n",
    "\n",
    "            try (PreparedStatement ps = con.prepareStatement(incrementSQL)) {\n",
    "                int resultSet = ps.executeUpdate();\n",
    "            } catch (SQLException e) {\n",
    "                con.rollback();\n",
    "                e.printStackTrace();\n",
    "                throw e;\n",
    "            }\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Build your JAR file\n",
    "1. `Build -> Artifacts... JAR`\n",
    "2. Use your command line interface to navigate to where the JAR file is created, e.g. out/artifacts/CompanyACustom1_jar/Custom1.jar\n",
    "\n",
    "You are now ready to deploy your JAR file to test!\n"

    "## Development Guidelines\n",
    "Before we develop the code and deploy the JAR file, it is worth going through some simple best practices:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It's useful for code organization to use a package for the code, e.g. com.splicemachine.yourcompanyname.\n",
    "2. Notice you don't need a *main* code block in your class, because you'll be directly calling the class's specific method.\n",
    "3. The example we've shown is a stored procedure, which means it does not return any results. When you create a function, it must return a result.\n",
    "4. You need to ensure that your method throws `SQLException` if SQL is being executed.  Be sure to use `try/catch` blocks similar to those shown in the example, to deal with any possible run-time exceptions.\n"
