    "### About Predicates\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting on the bottom line, we see an `IndexScan` with the preds specification on it; this is called a *Predicate Pushdown*. A pushdown means: when we perform this `IndexScan`, we'll bring this predicate (`A.J = 700000`) along with us, and will perform the scan using this predicate, passing up to the next part of the plan ONLY the rows that match. Predicate pushdowns are extremely efficient when performed on keyed results (primary keys or indexes), because only the minimal number of rows are pushed up to the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other kind of predicate shown here is of the form `[(A.I[5:1] = B.I[5:3])]`. You can ignore the numbers for now; the key part is `A.I = B.I`.  You can see that this is the join predicate, required for the actual join operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main takeaway is that, as with most databases: when you can *push down* a predicate that filters a lot of data with a keyed filter, it helps create efficient scans for that step. If the filter is not keyed, this becomes a potential opportunity for adding an index."

    "\n",
    "When you look at an explain plan, if you are unsure of the ordering, remember again that the order is *bottom up*. Another way to view this is to look at the counts on each row of the plan (n=1, n=2, etc.).  This dictates the table ordering being used."
